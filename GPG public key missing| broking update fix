Hello interwabbers 

on parrot we some times encounter problems with the GPG pub key. 
here is how to fix it and get it updating again. 

this fix also works for other versions of linux as long you change the gpg pub key or the distribo /os 

wget -qO - https://archive.parrotsec.org/parrot/misc/parrotsec.gpg | apt-key add - 

for other os follow following 
visit the page of of os and look for its latets package/misc/os.gpg and replace it with the url in the code above. 
copy past the modify code in terminal and apt-get update --fix-missing
